        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Brandon Horn and I am a multi-talented individual. I am a self-taught web developer and graphic designer, with a diploma in Public Administration and Management which gave me a strong foundation in project management and organization.

I am always eager to learn new skills in web development and graphic design, and always strive to create beautiful, functional designs for clients.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I am dedicated to giving back to my community. I volunteer at Ceres High School, where I assist students with extra classes, and work as a matric examination invigilator to ensure that the exams are conducted fairly.

Music is also my passion. I enjoy playing and writing music and I have volunteered at the local radio station WRFM, where I helped with programming and production.

In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing and have even climbed some of the most challenging routes in the country.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and getting to know me better.</p>
